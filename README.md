# HTMLColors

Add all the colour options from HTML/CSS to SwiftUI as well as the option to the possibility to use hex colours as well.


## How To Use
It's dead simple to use. All the colours have been divided into categories. Just add them using modifiers:
> `Text("Hello World").foregroundColor(.HTMLRed.fireBrick)`
> `Text("Lorem Ipsum").background(Color.HTMLPurple.mediumOrchid)`
> 
###Hex colours must start with '#'

> `Text("ABC123").foregroundColor(.hex("#C0C0C0"))`
> `Text("Hello World").background(Color.hex("#00F"))`
